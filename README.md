#### Description of files in the folder:

knockTF.zip - [knockTF](https://bio.liclab.net/KnockTFv1/) TR perturbation experiment derived genes, including the original data sourced from the knockTF database and benchmarking used top 200/600/1000 genes. 

Benchmark_Results.zip - Output generated by running methods over the derived input gene sets.

Clean_Results.zip - results integrated into one table per method.

### Commands and scripts
Command and scripts run on Ubuntu 22.04, SMU M3 high-performance computing (HPC) cluster.

#### Commands:
Please make sure the requirements are satisfied before running the command/scripts.
